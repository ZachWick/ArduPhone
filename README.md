The ArduPhone Project
=====================

# 1. Purpose
  The purpose of the ArduPhone project is to create a fully Free (as in freedom) and open cellular phone. In order to achieve this goal, only free and open hardware and software can and will be used.

# 2. Scope
  Creating a free cellular network is outside the scope of the ArduPhone project. The scope of the ArduPhone project limited to a completely free cell phone handset.

# 3. Reason
  As the world becomes more and more connected at all times through the phones that are carried in our pockets, there is an ever increasing risk of inadvertently giving up your inherent freedoms to cellphone manufacturers and OEM's. The ability to know exactly how your phone connects to the your carrier's network and how your phone respond to your inputs are neccessary to ensure that your freedom and privacy are not being infringed. Also, how awesome will it be to use a cell phone that you built?

# 4. Project Roadmap
  The project roadmap is only as I see it at this very moment. It is subject to change (hopefully it does) and I encourage civil discussion as to how the ArduProject reaches its goal.
1. Working prototype
 * can connect to a carrier's GSM network
 * can place calls
 * can recieve calls
 * can place SMS messages
 * can recieve SMS messages
2. Improve the hardware set to make a smaller form factor
3. Figure out a hardware set to minimize the cost of parts
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the ArduPhone is comparable to mainstream cell phones.

# 5. Communtity
  * Code Repository:
       https://github.com/ZachWick/ArduPhone
  * IRC
       #arduphone on irc.freenode.net
  * Mailing list
       forth coming

# 6. Contributing
  Contribute in any way that you are able and willing. Hack on some code, redesign hardware, write documentation, or write some rhetoric. Do whatever you feel will benefit the ArduPhone project.
