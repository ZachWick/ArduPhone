The ArduPhone Project
=====================

# 1. Purpose
  The purpose of the ArduPhone project is to create a fully Free (as in freedom) and open cellular phone. In order to achieve this goal, only free and open hardware and software can and will be used.

# 2. Scope
  Creating a free cellular network is outside the scope of the ArduPhone project. The scope of the ArduPhone project limited to a completely free cell phone handset.

# 3. Reason
  As the world becomes more and more connected at all times through the phones that are carried in our pockets, there is an ever increasing risk of inadvertently giving up your inherent freedoms to cellphone manufacturers and OEM's. The ability to know exactly how your phone connects to the your carrier's network and how your phone respond to your inputs are neccessary to ensure that your freedom and privacy are not being infringed. Also, how awesome will it be to use a cell phone that you built?

# 4. Project Roadmap
  The project roadmap is only as I see it at this very moment. It is subject to change (hopefully it does) and I encourage civil discussion as to how the ArduProject reaches its goal.

1. Working prototype
	* can connect to a carrier's GSM network
	* can place calls
	* can recieve calls
	* can place SMS messages
	* can recieve SMS messages
2. Improve the hardware set to make a smaller form factor
3. Figure out a hardware set to minimize the cost of parts
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the ArduPhone is comparable to mainstream cell phones.

# 7. The ArduPhone Manifesto
  "A man has a property in his opinions and the free communication of them." - James Madison
  "A monopoly on the means of communication may define a ruling elite more precisely than the celebrated Marxian formula of monopoly in the means of production." Robert Anton Wilson
  "We are defined by how we use our power." Gerry Spence
  "This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud." The Hacker Manifesto
  
  There are countless networks coursing through you at any given time. These networks you to your friends, your family, your online presence, and the rest of the world. All this connectivity comes a price though - the price of your freedom. How many people and agencies have a constant feed on your exact location all because of the pieces of silicon and metal in your pocket; all because of your cellphone. How many apps on your smart phone are transmitting your calendar, your address book, your personal data to their servers where you are no longer in control of it? Data security aside, how does your cellphone even work? Do you know how your phone connects to the telephone network?
