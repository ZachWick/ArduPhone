Licensing scheme for the ArduPhone project by
   Zach Wick (@ZachWick, ZachWick on Github)

1. Code:
   All code is LGPL-3.0 license (GNU Lesser General Public License v3).
   I chose this license because I feel that it allows the
   greatest amount of freedom to every user.

2. Documentation:
   All documentation, including schematics, are released under the
   GNU Free Documentation License (GNU FDL)

3. Data Sheets:
   I do not claim any kind of copyright on the included data sheets, so I cannot
   choose the licensing that they are used under. Any included datasheet is what
   I found when searching online for one.
