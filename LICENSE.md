Licensing scheme for the ArduPhone project by
   Zach Wick (@ZachWick, ZachWick on Github)

1. Code:
   All code is dual released under both the MIT license and the GPL-3.0 license.
   I chose this dual licensing structure because I feel that it allows the
   greatest amount of freedom to every user - including the freedom to choose
   the license that they use my code under.

2. Documentation:
   All documentation, including schematics, are released under the
   GNU Free Documentation License (GNU FDL)

3. Data Sheets:
   I do not claim any kind of copyright on the included data sheets, so I cannot
   choose the licensing that they are used under. Any included datasheet is what
   I found when searching online for one.
